## LabVIEW Sketches<br/>
The files are small projects used as data aquisition for various test methods I used at my professional job.<br/>
I will update this README as projects are added/uploaded. <br/>
**SerialReadDHT11**: This file will open a VISA serial interface and read the data out. I cant say what I originally used it for so I <br/>
the code to capture temperature and humidty readings from a DHT11 sensor. <br/>
**button_tester**: This file was used to capture the number of cycles a NC SPST button switch was actuated during a reliability test.<br/>
It works by detecting the falling edge of a small voltage (2V) dropping from 5V as the actuator depresses the switch and opens it.<br/>
**straingauge_04-03-18**: This was created to measure the various voltage levels of a rosette straingauge along with a NI9219 <br/> 
**Shock_Capture_Rev.B***: Updated script for capturing accelerometer readings during vibration or shock testing.<br/>
**ActuatorCal***: Captures strain data for calibrating a MLC-3K load cell.<br/>
